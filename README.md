# Character-Prediction

In this machine learning project, I will recognize handwritten characters, i.e, English alphabets from A-Z. This we are going to achieve by modeling a neural network that will have to be trained over a dataset containing images of alphabets.

What is CNN?  
CNN stands for Convolutional Neural Networks that are used to extract the features of the images using several layers of filters. The convolution layers are generally followed by maxpool layers that are used to reduce the number of features extracted and ultimately the output of the maxpool and layers and convolution layers are flattened into a vector of single dimension and are given as an input to the Dense layer.

Conclusion  
We have successfully developed Handwritten character recognition (Text Recognition) with Python, Tensorflow, and Machine Learning libraries. Handwritten characters have been recognized with more than 97% test accuracy. This can be also further extended to identifying the handwritten characters of other languages too.
